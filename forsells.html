             <h3  class="partsideh3">Property Evaluation  </h3>
             <p class="partsidep"> I'm not doing our sellers a service by misleading them or letting them proceed without a thorough,
							  honest and objective evaluation of their property prior to pricing and going to market. Let me give you this opinion, but also ideas and strategies to improve your property in the current market environment.</p>
             <h3 class="partsideh3">Proper List Pricing </h3>
                <p class="partsidep"> Properties listed at the right price sell fastest and put the most money into their sellers’ pockets. Under–pricing, isn’t common, but can cost you money you really need to move on in life.
									Over–pricing is a really bad practice that can keep a property on the market longer than necessary and end up with price reductions and low–ball offers.  </p>
             <h3 class="partsideh3"> Market Updates </h3>
                <p class="partsidep">Markets are like the weather, always changing. I’ll keep you updated on market conditions and how they may call for price changes or other actions to adapt.</p>
             <h3 class="partsideh3">Price Negotiations </h3>
                <p class="partsidep"> Good markets or slow markets, buyers are always trying to pay the lowest price or negotiate for seller concessions. I do this every day, and I’ll help you to respond to offers
									and counter offers unemotionally and with the very best end result.</p>
             <h3 class="partsideh3">Inspections, Repair Negotiations </h3>
                <p class="partsidep">Price negotiations are only the beginning. Once a contract is in place, there are documents, disclosures and inspections to get past.
									Any of these items can result in further negotiations and can make or break a deal.</P>
             <h3 class="partsideh3">Contract to Closing</h3>
                <p class="partsidep"> Dozens of detailed tasks, document deliveries, deadlines, inspections and mortgage details are all in store between a price agreement, contract and a closing.
									I'm on every one of them and will keep your transaction organized and moving.</p>
